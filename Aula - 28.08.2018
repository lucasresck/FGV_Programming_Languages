So the original would return [2, 1], could be a list of players sorted by their scores for example, discarding the scores. – gseattle Jul 17 '15 at 3:49  show 1 more comment 9 Answers active oldest votes up vote 147 down vote To get the values use  sorted(data.values()) To get the matching keys, use a key function  sorted(data, key=data.get) To get a list of tuples ordered by value  sorted(data.items(), key=lambda x:x[1]) Related: see the discussion here: Dictionaries are ordered in Python 3.6+  shareimprove this answer edited Aug 8 '17 at 20:32 answered May 27 '13 at 11:23  John La Rooy 200k36260413 Ok, sorry. What I meant was to get (2:'a',1:'b')... any ideas? – kingRauk May 27 '13 at 12:18 1 @kingRauk, dict's are unordered, but you can make an ordered list of tuples – John La Rooy May 27 '13 at 12:54 1 sorted(data.items(), key=lambda x:x[1], reverse=True) for reveresed order – Mannu Mar 5 at 8:33 add a comment  up vote 31 down vote If you actually want to sort the dictionary instead of just obtaining a sorted list use collections.OrderedDict  >>> from collections import OrderedDict >>> from operator import itemgetter >>> data = {1: 'b', 2: 'a'} >>> d = OrderedDict(sorted(data.items(), key=itemgetter(1))) >>> d OrderedDict([(2, 'a'), (1, 'b')]) >>> d.values() ['a', 'b'] shareimprove this answer answered May 27 '13 at 11:53  jamylak 78k17171191 The sad thing is that is in Python 2.6.5... that does not support OrderedDict – kingRauk May 27 '13 at 12:40 5 @kingRauk then don't tag your question Python 2.7.... Also a lot of things you have mentioned in the comments should have been in your question to begin with – jamylak May 27 '13 at 12:41  Yeah, sorry for that... – kingRauk May 27 '13 at 12:53 @kingRauk No problem at all, it's all good – jamylak May 19 '15 at 12:32  add a comment up vote 15 down vote From your comment to gnibbler answer, i'd say you want a list of pairs of key-value sorted by value:  sorted(data.items(), key=lambda x:x[1]) shareimprove this answer answered May 27 '13 at 12:35  njzk2 31.7k44987 add a comment up vote 7 down vote Sort the values:  sorted(data.values()) returns  ['a','b'] shareimprove this answer answered May 27 '13 at 11:23  eumiro 119k14210224 add a comment up vote 7 down vote Thanks for all answers. You are all my heros ;-)  Did in the end something like this:  d = sorted(data, key = d.get)  for id in d:     text = data[id] shareimprove this answer answered May 27 '13 at 13:01  kingRauk 4981619 add a comment up vote 4 down vote I also think it is important to note that Python dict object type is a hash table (more on this here), and thus is not capable of being sorted without converting its keys/values to lists. What this allows is  dict item retrieval in constant time O(1), no matter the size/number of elements in a dictionary.  Having said that, once you sort its keys - sorted(data.keys()), or values - sorted(data.values()), you can then use that list to access keys/values in design patterns such as these:  for sortedKey in sorted(dictionary):     print dictionary[sortedKeY] # gives the values sorted by key  for sortedValue in sorted(dictionary.values()):     print sortedValue # gives the values sorted by value Hope this helps.  shareimprove this answer edited May 27 '13 at 12:00 answered May 27 '13 at 11:37  Morgan Wilde 8,80883881 3 sorted(dictionary) is better than sorted(dictionary.keys()) – jamylak May 27 '13 at 11:50 @jamylak thanks for the suggestion, but I wonder if it behaves in a different pattern then what .keys() would do? – Morgan Wilde May 27 '13 at 12:01 1 It's semantically equivalent but faster and more idiomatic – jamylak May 27 '13 at 12:04 add a comment up vote 1 down vote In your comment in response to John, you suggest that you want the keys and values of the dictionary, not just the values.  PEP 256 suggests this for sorting a dictionary by values.  import operator sorted(d.iteritems(), key=operator.itemgetter(1)) If you want descending order, do this  sorted(d.iteritems(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True) shareimprove this answer answered Nov 10 '16 at 19:08  Christian Long 3,48413235 add a comment up vote 0 down vote no lambda method  # sort dictionary by value d = {'a1': 'fsdfds', 'g5': 'aa3432ff', 'ca':'zz23432'} def getkeybyvalue(d,i):     for k, v in d.items():         if v == i:             return (k)  sortvaluelist = sorted(d.values()) sortresult ={} for i1 in sortvaluelist:        key = getkeybyvalue(d,i1)     sortresult[key] = i1 print ('=====sort by value=====') print (sortresult) print ('=======================') shareimprove this answer answered May 24 '17 at 3:35  xiyurui 10114 add a comment up vote 0 down vote You could created sorted list from Values and rebuild the dictionary:  myDictionary={\"two\":\"2\", \"one\":\"1\", \"five\":\"5\", \"1four\":\"4\"}  newDictionary={}  sortedList=sorted(myDictionary.values())  for sortedKey in sortedList:     for key, value in myDictionary.items():         if value==sortedKey:             newDictionary[key]=value Output: newDictionary={'one': '1', 'two': '2', '1four': '4', 'five': '5'}  shareimprove this answer answered Sep 29 '17 at 20:42  Marius 162 add a comment Your Answer    Sign up or log in  Sign up using Google  Sign up using Facebook  Sign up using Email and Password   Post as a guest Name  Email  required, but never shown  Post Your Answer By clicking \"Post Your Answer\", you acknowledge that you have read our updated terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy, and that your continued use of the website is subject to these policies.
